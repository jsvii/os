*** Compound Comparison

-a   logical and, Similar to &&

-o   logical or, Similar to ||

*** Integer Comparison

-eq   is equal to

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

-ne   is not equal to

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

-gt   is greater than

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

-ge   is greater than or equal to

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

-lt   is less than

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

-le   is less than or equal to

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

< is less than (within double parentheses)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
(("$a" < "$b"))
#+END_SRC

<=   is less than or equal to (within double parentheses)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
(("$a" <= "$b"))
#+END_SRC

> is greater than (within double parentheses)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
(("$a" > "$b"))
#+END_SRC

>=   is greater than or equal to (within double parentheses)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
(("$a" >= "$b"))
#+END_SRC

*** String Comparison

=   is equal to

~==~  The ~==~ comparison operator behaves differently within a double-brackets test than within single brackets.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
[[ $a == z* ]]   # True if $a starts with an "z" (pattern matching).
[[ $a == "z*" ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).

[ $a == z* ]     # File globbing and word splitting take place.
[ "$a" == "z*" ] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).
#+END_SRC

~!=~   is not equal to, This operator uses pattern matching within a ~[[...]]~ construct.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$a" != "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

<   is less than, in ~ASCII alphabetical order~

   Note that the < needs to be escaped within a [ ] construct.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]
if [ "$a" \< "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

>   is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order.

Note that the > needs to be escaped within a [ ] construct.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]
if [ "$a" \> "$b" ]
#+END_SRC

-z   string is null, that is, has zero length

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ -z "$s" ]
#+END_SRC

-n   string is not null.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ -n "$s" ]
#+END_SRC

*** File Test Operators

-e   file exists

-a   -a is deprecated and its use is discouraged.

-f   file is a regular file (not a directory or device file)

-d   file is a directory

-h, -L   file is a symbolic link

-b   file is a block device

-c   file is a character device

-p   file is a pipe

-S   file is a socket

-s   file is not zero size

-t   file (descriptor) is associated with a terminal device. This test option may be used to check whether the stdin [ -t 0 ] or stdout [ -t 1 ] in a given script is a terminal.

-r   file has read permission (for the user running the test)

-w   file has write permission (for the user running the test)

-x   file has execute permission (for the user running the test)

-g   set-group-id (sgid) flag set on file or directory

-u   set-user-id (suid) flag set on file

-k   sticky bit set

-O   you are owner of file

-G   group-id of file same as yours

-N   file modified since it was last read

-nt   file f1 is newer than f2

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$f1" -nt "$f2" ]
#+END_SRC

-ot   file f1 is older than f2

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$f1" -ot "$f2" ]
#+END_SRC

-ef   files f1 and f2 are hard links to the same file

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$f1" -ef "$f2" ]
#+END_SRC

!   "not" -- reverses the sense of the tests above (returns true if condition absent).

1. 单括号是代表 test, 双括号是更现代的 Bash, Zsh, Ksh 才支持的

1. 更多区别，参考下面图表 (表格 中 ~¦¦~ 代表 ~||~ ，否则 org-mode无法解释图表)

**** [] 单方括号test

- ~[ ]~ 两个符号左右都要有空格分隔

- 内部操作符与操作变量之间要有空格：如  =[ "a" = "b" ]=

- 字符串比较中， =>= , =<= 需要写成 =\>=, =\<= 进行转义

- =[ ]= 中字符串或者 ${} 变量尽量使用 =""= 双引号扩住，避免值未定义引用而出错

- =[ ]= 中可以使用 –a –o 进行逻辑运算

- =[ ]= 是bash 内置命令：[ is a shell builtin

**** [[]] (())双方括号test

双括号的test中的表达式更符合C语言风格，但双括号test 非 POSIX build-in。

- ~[[]]~ 与 ~(())~ 是一样的

- ~[[]]~ 两个符号左右都要有空格分隔

- 内部操作符与操作变量之间要有空格：如  =[[ "a" = "b" ]]=

- 字符串比较中，可以直接使用 > < 无需转义

- ~[[]]~ 中字符串或者 ${} 变量如未使用 ~""~ 双引号的话，会进行正式的模式和元字符匹配

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
[[ "ab" = a* ]] && echo "ok"
# a*被解释为模式匹配了
# ok

[[ $a == z* ]]   # True if $a starts with an "z" (pattern matching).
[[ $a == "z*" ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).

[ $a == z* ]     # File globbing and word splitting take place.
[ "$a" == "z*" ] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).
#+END_SRC



- =[[ ]]= 内部可以使用 &&  || 进行逻辑运算

= =[[ ]]= 是bash  keyword：[[ is a shell keyword 而非内置命令



There are several differences. In my opinion, a few of the most important are:

   1. [ is a builtin in Bash and many other modern shells. The builtin [ is similar to test with the additional requirement of a closing]. The builtins [ and test imitate the functionality /bin/ [ and /bin/test along with their limitations so that scripts would be backwards compatible. The original executables still exist mostly for POSIX compliance and backwards compatibility. Running the command type [ in Bash indicates that [ is interpreted as a builtin by default. (Note: which [ only looks for executables on the PATH and is equivalent to type -p []

   1. [[ is not as compatible, it won't necessarily work with whatever /bin/sh points to. So [[ is the more modern Bash / Zsh / Ksh option.

   1. Because [[ is built into the shell and does not have legacy requirements, you don't need to worry about word splitting based on the IFS variable to mess up on variables that evaluate to a string with spaces. Therefore, you don't really need to put the variable in double quotes.

For the most part, the rest is just some nicer syntax. To see more differences, I recommend this link to an FAQ answer: What is the difference between test, [ and [[ ?. In fact, if you are serious about bash scripting, I recommend reading the entire wiki, including the FAQ, Pitfalls, and Guide. The test section from the guide section explains these differences as well, and why the author (s) think [[ is a better choice if you don't need to worry about being as portable. The main reasons are:

    1. You don't have to worry about quoting the left-hand side of the test so that it actually gets read as a variable.

    1. You don't have to escape less than and greater than < > with backslashes in order for them not to get evaluated as input redirection, which can really mess some stuff up by overwriting files. This again goes back to [[ being a builtin. If [ (test) is an external program the shell would have to make an exception in the way it evaluates < and > only if /bin/test is being called, which wouldn't really make sense.



「brackets」和「parentheses」指的都是括号，因此容易混淆。 一般来说，parentheses 指的是圆括号 ()，而brackets 指的是方括号 []。 然而，现在的人已经倾向直接称圆括号为「round brackets」，而方括号则称为「square brackets」


** demos

*** 数值测试

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
num1=100
num2=100
if test $[num1] -eq $[num2]
then
    echo '两个数相等！'
else
    echo '两个数不相等！'
fi
# 输出结果：
两个数相等！
#+END_SRC

代码中的 [] 执行基本的算数运算，如：
#!/bin/bash

a=5
b=6
result=$[a+b] # 注意等号两边不能有空格
echo "result 为： $result"

结果为:
result 为： 11

*** 字符串测试

1. ===  等于则为真

1. =!==  不相等则为真

1. =-z= 字符串  字符串的长度为零则为真

1. =-n= 字符串  字符串的长度不为零则为真

实例演示：
num1="ru1noob"
num2="runoob"
if test $num1 = $num2
then
    echo '两个字符串相等!'
else
    echo '两个字符串不相等!'
fi

输出结果：


两个字符串不相等!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** 文件测试

cd /bin
if test -e ./bash
then
    echo '文件已存在!'
else
    echo '文件不存在!'
fi

输出结果：


文件已存在!

*** Shell还提供了与( -a )、或( -o )、非( ! )三个逻辑操作符用于将测试条件连接起来，其优先级为："!"最高，"-a"次之，"-o"最低。例如：

cd /bin
if test -e ./notFile -o -e ./bash
then
    echo '至少有一个文件存在!'
else
    echo '两个文件都不存在'
fi

输出结果：
