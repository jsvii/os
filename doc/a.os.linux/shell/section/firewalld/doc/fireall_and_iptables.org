* firewall与iptables的区别


A firewall is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through.

- On the one hand, iptables is a tool for managing firewall rules on a Linux machine.

- On the other hand, firewalld is also a tool for managing firewall rules on a Linux machine.


firewalld用来管理iptables, 底层还是iptables在起作用
