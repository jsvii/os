* hardware clock

** Set hardware clock

The hardware clock is the clock that runs in you PC hardware even if you disconnect it from the main power supply. This is because it has a lithium battery in the modern computers and another type of battery in the old ones.

We'll see differences between hardware clock and system clock

hwclock --show

Will output something like this:

Thu 19 Apr 2012 03:23:05 PM BOT  -0.785086 seconds

Now check the system clock

date

Will output something like this:

Thu Apr 19 15:26:41 BOT 2012

Let's set the hardware clock to local time:

hwclock --set --date="2012-04-19 16:45:05" --localtime

If you want to set it to UTC time use:

hwclock --set --date="2011-04-19 20:45:05"  --utc

*** set with system clock

hwclock -w

hwclock --systohc
