4731 &nbsp;* The following several routines allocate and free 

4732 &nbsp;* buffers with various side effects. In general the 

4733 &nbsp;* arguments to an allocate routine are a device and 

4734 &nbsp;* a block number, and the value is a pointer to 

4735 &nbsp;* the buffer header; the buffer is marked "busy" 

4736 &nbsp;* so that no one else can touch it. If the block was 

4737 &nbsp;* already in core, no I/O need be done; if it is 

4738 &nbsp;* already busy, the process waits until it becomes free. 

4739 &nbsp;* The following routines allocate a buffer: 

4740 &nbsp;* getblk 

4741 &nbsp;* bread 

4742 &nbsp;* breada 

4743 &nbsp;* Eventually the buffer must be released, possibly with the 

4744 &nbsp;* side effect of writing it out, by using one of 

4745 &nbsp;* bwrite 

4746 &nbsp;* bdwrite 

4747 &nbsp;* bawrite 

4748 &nbsp;* brelse
