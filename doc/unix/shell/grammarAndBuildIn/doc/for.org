~for~ loops loop on the positional parameters if no ~in value1 value2...~  part is specified in all Bourne-like shells.

That was already the case in the Bourne shell from the late 70s, though in the Bourne shell, you'd need to omit that ; (you can also use for i do (except in some old ash versions where you need a newline before the do)).

See What is the purpose of the "do" keyword in Bash for loops? for more information including more surprising variants.

Doing:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
for i
do
  something with "$i"
done
#+END_SRC

is good practice. It's slightly more portable/reliable than the usually equivalent:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
for i in "$@"; do
  something with "$i"
done
#+END_SRC
