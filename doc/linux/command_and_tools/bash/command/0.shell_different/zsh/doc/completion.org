* Completion 

The shell's ~programmable completion mechanism~ can be manipulated in two ways 

- Completion Widgets

- Completion System

here the low-level features supporting the newer, function-based mechanism are defined.

A complete set of shell functions based on these
features is described in the next chapter, *note Completion System::,
and users with no interest in adding to that system

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/zsh/code zsh-code
#+END_SRC


- Completion Special Parameters

- Completion Builtin Commands

- Completion Condition Codes

- Completion Matching Control

- Completion Widget Example


Completion widgets are defined by the -C option to the zle builtin command provided by the zsh/zle module (see *note The zsh/zle Module::). For example,

zle -C complete expand-or-complete completer
