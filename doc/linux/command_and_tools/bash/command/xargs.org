* xargs

** $1 被忽略

ps ax | grep -E "bar" | grep -v "grep" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill -9 $1

~xargs~ reads list from stdin so just discard the last $1 on the line if what you want is to kill processes by their PIDs.

As a side note, ps can also print processes according to their command name (with procps on linux see the -C option).
