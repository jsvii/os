4539 &nbsp;* Each block device has a devtab, which contains private 

4540 &nbsp;* state stuff and 2 list heads: the b_forw/b_back list, 

4541 &nbsp;* which is doubly linked and has all the buffers currently 

4542 &nbsp;* associated with the major device; 

4543 &nbsp;* and the d_actf/d_actl list, which is private to the 

4544 &nbsp;* device but in fact is always used for the head and tail 

4545 &nbsp;* of the I/O queue for the device. 

4546 &nbsp;* Various routines in bio.c look at b_forw/b_back 

4547 &nbsp;* (notice they are the same as in the buf structure) 

4548 &nbsp;* but the rest is private to each device driver.
